## Exercise 2.9
1. Using a series of matrix of stock returns:
   a) Compute the covariance matrix. What is the condition number of the correlation matrix?
   b) Compute one hundredth efficient frontiers by drawing one hundred alternative vectors of expected returns from a Normal distribution with mean 10% and std 10%.
   c) Compute the variance of the errors against the mean efficient frontier.

## Function Descriptions
### `get_OL_tickers_close(T=936, N=234)`
- `N`: Number of stocks in portfolio.
- `T`: Lookback time.

### `test_exception_in_plotting_efficient_frontier(S_value)`

Test raising of exception when plotting the efficient frontier.
