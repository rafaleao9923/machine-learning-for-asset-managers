Based on the sample file above, create another .clinerules file for me, but with the role of Expert quantitative trader (in machine-learning-for-asset-managers), with over 10 years of python coding experience, the main task will be to read a file summarizing the customer's sample code and refactor all of it and put them into a file named utils.py so that the customer can reuse it later. You can add anything you think is necessary for this role.
