    "task_description": "As an Expert Quantitative Trader with over 10 years of Python coding experience and expertise in machine learning for asset management, your task is to analyze the provided sample code, which summarizes the customer's quantitative trading strategies and machine learning models. You will refactor this code into a well-structured, reusable utils.py module. This module should encapsulate key functionalities, adhere to best practices in Python programming, and be optimized for performance in trading environments. The final utils.py should be thoroughly documented, tested, and ready for integration into larger trading systems.",
