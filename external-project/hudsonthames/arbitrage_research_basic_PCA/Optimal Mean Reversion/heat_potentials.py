# ## Abstract


# An Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a great tool for modeling the behavior of mean-reverting portfolio prices. Alexandr Lipton and Marcos Lopez de Prado present a methodology that allows to obtain a closed-form solution for the optimal mean-reverting trading strategies based on the OU model characteristics and the heat potential approach. The optimal trading rule, namely, optimal stop-loss and optimal profit-taking level are found by maximizing the approximated value of the Sharpe ratio.


# ## Data scaling


# **NOTE:**
# >In this approach we use the volume clock metric instead of the time-based metric. More on that in the paper
# [**"The Volume Clock: Insights into the High Frequency Paradigm"**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2034858) by David Easley, Marcos Lopez de Prado, and Maureen O'Hara


# Let's presume an investment strategy S is a long investment strategy with p/l driven by the OU process:
#
# $$dx' = \mu'(\theta'-x')dt'+\sigma'dW_{t'}, x'(0) = 0$$


# and a trading rule $R = \{ \bar{\pi}',\underline{\pi}',T' \}$. To make the application of the method of heat potentials possible we transform it to use its steady-state by performing scaling to remove superfluous parameters.
#
# $$t = \mu't',\ T = \mu'T',\ x = \frac{\sqrt{\mu'}}{\sigma'} x',\ \theta = \frac{\sqrt{\mu'}}{\sigma'} \theta',\ \bar{\pi} = \frac{\sqrt{\mu'}}{\sigma'} \bar{\pi}',
# \ \underline{\pi} = \frac{\sqrt{\mu'}}{\sigma'} \underline{\pi}'$$


# And get:
# $$dx = (\theta-x)dt + dW_t, \ \bar{\pi}' \leq x \leq \underline{\pi},\ 0 \leq t \leq T$$


# **NOTE:**
#
# >Short strategy reverses the roles of ${\bar{\pi}',\underline{\pi}'}$:
# >
# >$-\underline{\pi}$ equals the profit taken when the price hits $\underline{\pi}$ and
# >
# >$-\bar{\pi}$ losses are incurred while price hits $-\bar{\pi}$
#
#


# Hence, we can restrict ourself to case with $\theta \geq 0$.


# ## Sharpe ratio calculation
#
# The calculation of the Sharpe ratio follows the four-step algorithm:
# ***
# **Step 1: Define a calculation grid**
#
# First of all we define the grid $\upsilon$ based on which we will perform our numerical calculation:
#
# $$ 0=\upsilon_0<\upsilon_1<...<\upsilon_n=\Upsilon,\  \upsilon(t) = \frac{1 - e^{-2(T-t)}}{2}$$
#
# **Step 2: Numerically calculate helper functions** $\bar{\epsilon}, \underline{\epsilon}, \bar{\phi}, \underline{\phi}$
#
# We are going to use the classical method of heat potentials to calculate the SR.
# As a preparation, in this step, we solve the two sets of Volterra equations by using the trapezoidal rule of integral calculation.
#
# **Step 3: Calculate the values of** $\hat{E}(\Upsilon,\bar{\omega})$ **and** $\hat{F}(\Upsilon,\bar{\omega})$
#
# We need to compute these functions at one point, which can be done by approximation of the integrals using the
# trapezoidal rule:
#
# $$\hat{E}(\Upsilon,\bar{\omega}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^k(\underline{w}_{n,i}\underline{\epsilon}_i + \underline{w}_{n,i-1}\underline{\epsilon}_{i-1} + \bar{w}_{n,i}\bar{\epsilon}_i + \bar{w}_{n,i-1}\bar{\epsilon}_{i-1})(\upsilon_i - \upsilon_{i-1})$$
#
# $$ \hat{F}(\Upsilon,\bar{\omega}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^k(\underline{w}_{n,i}\underline{\phi}_i + \underline{w}_{n,i-1}\underline{\phi}_{i-1} + \bar{w}_{n,i}\bar{\phi}_i + \bar{w}_{n,i-1}\bar{\phi}_{i-1})(\upsilon_i - \upsilon_{i-1})$$
#
# Where *w* are the weights.
#
# **Step 4: calculate the SR using the obtained values**
#
# The previously computed functions $\hat{E}(\Upsilon,\bar{\omega})$ and $\hat{F}(\Upsilon,\bar{\omega})$
# are substituted into the following formula to calculate the Sharpe ratio.
#
# $$SR = \frac{\hat{E}(\Upsilon,\bar{\omega}) - \frac{2(\bar{\omega}-\theta)}{ln(1-2\Upsilon)}}{\sqrt{\hat{F}(\Upsilon,\bar{\omega}) - (\hat{E}(\Upsilon,\bar{\omega}))^2 + \frac{4(\Upsilon + ln(1-2\Upsilon)(\bar{\omega}-\theta)\hat{E}(\Upsilon,\bar{\omega})}{(ln(1-2\Upsilon))^2}}}$$
#
#
# ***


# To find the optimal thresholds for the data provided by the user we maximize the calculated SR with respect to
# $\bar{\pi}\geq0,\underline{\pi}\leq0$**


# ## How to use the heat potentials module
#
# This module gives the ability to calculate optimal values for stop-loss and profit-taking level to construct the trading rule.


# Imports


from arbitragelab.optimal_mean_reversion import OrnsteinUhlenbeck
from arbitragelab.optimal_mean_reversion import HeatPotentials
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np


# Data preparation:
#
# Let's generate the OU data sample to example the whole model usage cycle.


# Generating the sample OU data
ou_data = OrnsteinUhlenbeck()

data = ou_data.ou_model_simulation(n=1000, theta_given=0.03711, mu_given=65.3333,
                            sigma_given=0.3, delta_t_given=1/255)


# Let's plot our data example
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 7))
plt.plot(data);


# The next step would be to fit the OU model and obtain its parameters:


# To get the model parameters we need to fit the OU model to the data

# Assign the delta value
ou_data.delta_t = 1/252

# Model fitting
ou_data.fit_to_portfolio(data)

# Now we obtained the parameters to use for our optimization procedure
theta,mu,sigma = ou_data.theta,ou_data.mu,np.sqrt(ou_data.sigma_square)


# Printing out fitted parameters
print('theta:', round(theta,5), '\nmu:', round(mu,5), '\nsigma:', round(sigma,5))


# Now we can perform the optimization process:


# To fit the model and calculate optimal thresholds we need to provide:
#
# * OU-model parameters that represent the data
# * The grid density
# * Maximum duration of the trade


# Establish the instance of the class
example = HeatPotentials()

# Fit the model and establish the maximum duration of the trade
example.fit(ou_params=(theta, mu, sigma), delta_grid=0.1, max_trade_duration=0.03)


# Let's calculate the optimal levels and SR separately. 
#
# To do so we can use the respective functions: 


# Calculate the initial optimal levels
levels = example.optimal_levels()


print('profit-taking threshold:', levels[0],
      '\nstop-loss threshold:', levels[1],
      '\nSharpe ratio:', levels[2])


# While calculating the Sharpe ratio separately we will use the rounded values of the optimal threshold to showcase the sensitivity of the approach to small differences in values.


# We can also calculate the Sharpe ratio for given scaled parameters
sr = example.sharpe_calculation(max_trade_duration=1.9599, optimal_profit=5.07525, optimal_stop_loss=-3.41002)

print(sr,'\ndelta:', levels[2]-sr)


# To get scaled back results that correspond to our model parameters we use the description function.


# To get the results scaled back to our initial model we call the description function
example.description()
