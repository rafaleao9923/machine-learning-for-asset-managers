## Introduction

### Motivation
- **Old Statistics**:  
  - Based on simple assumptions (linearity, independence) due to limited computing power.  
  - Relied on math-heavy methods because calculators were slow.  

- **Modern Statistics**:  
  - Computers enable better tools like cross-validation, bootstrapping, and Monte Carlo.  
  - These methods are more realistic and flexible than old ones.  

- **Finance Challenges**:  
  - Economic systems are too complex for old statistical tools.  
  - Machine Learning (ML) is now widely used in finance for better solutions.  

- **ML in Finance**:  
  - ML helps build better financial theories, not just predict prices.  
  - Backtesting isn’t enough; theories explain why strategies work.  

- **Goal of the Book**:  
  - Teaches ML techniques to help asset managers create testable financial theories.  
  - Focuses on using ML to gain a real edge in finance.  

### Theory Matters

- **Black Swans**:  
  - Extreme, unpredictable events (e.g., the 2010 Flash Crash).  
  - Some argue ML can’t predict them because they’re unseen in historical data.  

- **Flash Crash Example**:  
  - ML systems predicted the crash by detecting extreme order flow imbalances.  
  - Systems automatically reduced positions before the crash and bought back at the bottom.  
  - The crash was caused by a large sell order, creating toxic order flow.  

### Key Lessons:

1. **Lesson 1: You Need a Theory**  
   - Backtesting isn’t enough; strategies need a solid theoretical foundation.  
   - Theories explain both observed events and black swans.  
   - Example: VPIN theory predicted the Flash Crash and guided profitable actions.  

2. **Lesson 2: ML Helps Discover Theories**  
   - ML uncovers hidden variables in complex systems.  
   - Theories connect these variables into cause-effect relationships.  
   - ML decouples variable discovery from theory formulation.  
   - Example: ML identified order flow imbalances, but the theory explained the crash.  

### ML’s Role in Finance:  
- Best used for discovering theories, not just making predictions.  
- Theories, not ML algorithms, should drive decisions.  
- ML is a tool to uncover patterns, but theories provide the framework for action.  

### How Scientists Use ML

- **ML is Not a Black Box**:  
  - ML learns complex patterns without human guidance, but it’s not just a prediction machine.  
  - It can help uncover understanding, not just make predictions.  

### Key Uses of ML in Science:

1. **Existence**:  
   - ML evaluates the plausibility of theories.  
   - Helps discover new theorems or patterns in math and science.  
   - Example: ML can suggest undiscovered theorems for mathematicians to prove.  

2. **Importance**:  
   - ML identifies which variables (features) are most important for predictions.  
   - Example: Mean-Decrease Accuracy (MDA) measures how shuffling a feature affects prediction accuracy.  

3. **Causation**:  
   - ML helps test causal relationships.  
   - Steps:  
     - Predict outcomes without an effect.  
     - Compare predictions to actual outcomes with the effect.  
     - Use prediction errors to propose causal theories.  

4. **Reductionist**:  
   - ML simplifies complex, high-dimensional data for visualization.  
   - Example: Manifold learning clusters data into groups for easier analysis.  

5. **Retriever**:  
   - ML scans big data for patterns humans miss.  
   - Example: ML finds supernovae in telescope images, guiding further human investigation.  
   - Also used for outlier detection, identifying anomalies based on data structure.  

### ML’s Role in Science and Economics:  
- ML doesn’t replace theories; it helps scientists develop them.  
- Provides tools to analyze complex data and uncover new insights.  

### Two Types of Overfitting

- **Overfitting**:  
  - Happens when a model fits noise instead of the true signal.  
  - Leads to poor out-of-sample performance.  

---

### 1. **Train Set Overfitting**:  
   - **Cause**: Model is too flexible and fits noise in the training data.  
   - **Result**: High confidence in wrong predictions, poor generalization.  
   - **Solutions**:  
     - **Resampling**: Use cross-validation or Monte Carlo methods to evaluate generalization error.  
     - **Regularization**: Limit model complexity (e.g., LASSO, early stopping).  
     - **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models to reduce variance (e.g., random forests).  

---

### 2. **Test Set Overfitting**:  
   - **Cause**: Repeatedly tweaking a model or strategy to perform well on the test set.  
   - **Result**: False discoveries (e.g., lottery ticket analogy).  
   - **Solutions**:  
     - **Control for Multiple Tests**: Track the number of independent tests to avoid false discoveries (e.g., familywise error rate).  
     - **Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation (CPCV)**: Test on thousands of resampled train/test splits.  
     - **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Generate synthetic data to test strategies on a range of scenarios.  

---

### Key Takeaways:  
- **Backtests Aren’t Enough**:  
  - Backtests can’t simulate black swans or explain why a strategy works.  
  - Only theories can provide cause-effect mechanisms and testable predictions.  
- **ML Solutions**:  
  - Use ML to avoid overfitting and build robust strategies.  
  - Combine multiple methods (e.g., cross-validation, regularization, CPCV) for better results.  
- **Theory is Essential**:  
  - Theories explain both observed and unseen events (e.g., VPIN theory predicting the Flash Crash).  
  - Backtests are tools, but theories are the foundation of successful strategies.

### Five Popular Misconceptions about Financial ML

1. **ML Is the Holy Grail vs. ML Is Useless**:  
   - ML is neither a magic solution nor useless. It’s a tool that, when used correctly, can enhance financial analysis.  
   - Critics often overlook the limitations of classical statistical methods, which can lead to false positives or negatives.  
   - ML is modern statistics and offers solutions to the shortcomings of classical techniques.  

2. **ML Is a Black Box**:  
   - ML is not inherently a black box. It can be interpreted using methods like PDP, ICE, ALE, and Shapley values.  
   - Whether ML is seen as a black box depends on how it’s used, not the technology itself.  

3. **Finance Has Insufficient Data for ML**:  
   - While some ML algorithms require large datasets, many financial applications (e.g., risk analysis, portfolio construction) don’t rely on historical data.  
   - ML can work with smaller datasets or generate synthetic data for testing.  

4. **The Signal-to-Noise Ratio Is Too Low in Finance**:  
   - Financial data has a low signal-to-noise ratio, but ML can still extract meaningful patterns.  
   - ML should be used to discover theories, not just make predictions, to avoid overfitting noisy data.  

5. **ML Replaces Economic Theory**:  
   - ML doesn’t replace economic theory; it complements it.  
   - Theories should drive forecasts, not just ML algorithms.

---

### QA

#### Can quantitative methods predict black swan events?

- **Challenges**:  
  - Black swan events are rare and unpredictable by nature.  
  - Quantitative methods rely on historical data, which may not include black swans.  

- **Solutions**:  
  - ML can identify patterns (e.g., order flow imbalances) that may precede extreme events.  
  - Theories, like VPIN, can explain and predict black swans by understanding underlying mechanisms.  

---

## Denoising and Detoning

- **Motivation**:  
  - Covariance matrices in finance are noisy, affecting risk estimation and portfolio optimization.  
  - Denoising improves the signal-to-noise ratio, making data more reliable.  

- **Methods**:  
  - **Marcenko–Pastur Theorem**: Helps separate signal from noise in random matrices.  
  - **Targeted Shrinkage**: Adjusts noisy parts of data without affecting the signal.  
  - **Detoning**: Removes market-wide effects to better understand individual relationships.  

---

### Minimum Variance and Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio

- **Benefits of Denoising**:  
  - Reduces errors in portfolio optimization.  
  - Outperforms traditional shrinkage methods.  

- **Minimum Variance Portfolio**:
