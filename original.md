# Introduction

## Motivation

- Statistics is heavily influenced by the technological capabilities of its time.
- Classical **statistics** relies on simplistic assumptions due to historical limitations in computing power.
- Computational methods, such as **cross-validation** and **Monte Carlo** simulations, offer superior solutions.
- In finance, machine learning is increasingly crucial due to the complexity of economic systems.
- ML algorithms need adaptation for **financial time series data**, which is the focus of the book.

## Theory Matters

- **Black swans**, extreme events that have not been observed before, pose challenges for quantitative investment strategies.
- **Historical data may not directly** contain black swan events, but some black swans have been predicted.
- An anecdote about the "flash crash" of 2010 illustrates how systems can respond to **unforeseen events**.
- The flash crash was caused by **imbalanced order flow**, a common phenomenon in markets.
- Systems trained to recognize and respond to extreme conditions can sometimes anticipate and profit from black swan events.

### Lesson 1: You Need a Theory

- **Backtesting** alone is insufficient for strategy development; theories are essential.
- **Theories** should be robust enough to explain various scenarios, including black swan events.
- Theoretical **frameworks**, like the VPIN theory, can help predict and profit from extreme market events.
- **Theoretical** work can also contribute to market recovery after such events.
- The element provides tools to aid in the development of your own theories.

### Lesson 2: ML Helps Discover Theories

- ML tools help **identify hidden** variables crucial for **understanding complex** phenomena.
- Formulating a theory involves connecting these variables through a structural statement.
- A successful theory should have testable implications beyond ML predictions and explain both positives and negatives.
- ML decouples the search for variables from the **search** for specification, **enhancing** theory development.
- Once tested, the theory, not the ML algorithm, drives predictions and decisions.

## How Scientists Use ML

- ML algorithms can **evaluate** the plausibility of theories and even aid in making mathematical discoveries.
- Methods like **mean-decrease accuracy** help identify important variables in explanatory and predictive models.
- ML techniques are utilized for **causal inference**, aiding in the evaluation of cause-and-effect relationships.
- ML is essential for **visualizing complex** data sets and **clustering** observations for analysis.
- ML serves as a retriever, scanning big data for patterns, such as identifying **supernovae** or detecting **outliers**.
- ML doesn't replace theories but assists in forming them based on empirical evidence, offering economists powerful tools for theory development.

## Two Types of Overﬁtting

- ML algorithms can overfit data due to their flexibility, leading to a divergence between **in-sample and out-of-sample** performance.
- Two types of overfitting are distinguished: **overfitting on** the **training** set and overfitting on the **test** set.
- Proper management of both types of overfitting is essential for effective ML modeling.

### Train Set Overﬁtting

- Train set overfitting occurs when a model is **overly flexible and captures noise** along with the signal.
- ML researchers address train set overfitting through three main approaches: evaluating generalization error using resampling techniques, regularization methods to control model complexity, and ensemble techniques to reduce variance.
- Resampling techniques like cross-validation and Monte Carlo methods help evaluate generalization error.
- Regularization methods constrain model complexity, such as limiting parameters or model structure.
- Ensemble techniques, like random forests, combine forecasts from multiple models to reduce overfitting.
- These approaches help mitigate train set overfitting, improving model performance.

### Test Set Overﬁtting

- Test set overfitting occurs when multiple statistical tests are conducted on the same dataset, increasing the likelihood of false discoveries.
- Researchers may inadvertently overfit strategies during backtesting by adjusting parameters until desired performance is achieved.
- Test set overfitting is a significant issue in financial research, leading to potentially false discoveries.
- ML offers solutions to test set overfitting: controlling familywise error rate, generating synthetic datasets, and using combinatorial purged cross-validation.
- These approaches help mitigate the risk of overfitting models to test sets and improve the robustness of findings.
- Despite the usefulness of backtests, they cannot replace theories as they cannot simulate black swan events or provide causal explanations. Theories are essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms behind strategies and making predictions.

## Five Popular Misconceptions about Financial ML
### ML Is the Holy Grail versus ML Is Useless

- **Hype and counterhype surrounding ML** create unrealistic expectations and overlook its real value.
- **Critics** often downplay the importance of caveats in **classical statistical** methods, which can lead to **false positives or negatives**.
- Misunderstandings about the **central limit theorem** and linear regression can lead to misguided beliefs about the effectiveness of classical techniques.
- ML is seen as **modern statistics** and offers solutions to caveats in classical techniques.
- ML is compatible with the **scientific** method and offers interpretability through various methods.
- Whether ML is used as a **black box** or white box depends on personal choice, similar to other technical subjects.
- Viewing ML as a black box is not a universal truth and reflects individual preferences and applications.

### ML Is a Black Box

- ML being viewed as a **black box** is a widespread myth.
- ML is compatible with the **scientific** method and can be more insightful than traditional statistical methods.
- Various procedures exist to **interpret ML models**, including PDP, ICE, ALE, Friedman’s H-stat, MDI, MDA, global surrogate, LIME, and Shapley values.
- Whether ML is seen as a black box or white box depends on **personal choice**, similar to other technical subjects.
- Just because some individuals treat ML as a black box does not mean it is universally true; it reflects individual preferences and applications.

### Finance Has Insuﬃcient Data for ML

- While some ML algorithms in finance may **require large amounts of data**, many applications do not rely on historical data at all.
- Examples of such **applications include** risk analysis, portfolio construction, outlier detection, feature importance, and bet-sizing methods.
- Each section in the Element demonstrates the **mathematical** properties of ML without historical data.
- For instance, Section 7 evaluates the accuracy of an **ML-based portfolio** construction **algorithm** through Monte Carlo experiments, providing insights into general mathematical properties.
- Financial ML **applications** like sentiment analysis, deep hedging, credit ratings, execution, and private commercial datasets often have abundant data.
- Researchers can also conduct randomized controlled experiments in some settings, generating their own data to establish precise cause-effect mechanisms.

### The Signal-to-Noise Ratio Is Too Low in Finance

- Financial data sets in finance generally have a lower signal-to-noise ratio compared to other ML applications.
- Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, relying solely on black box predictions from ML models is not advisable in finance.
- Financial ML is not simply the application of standard ML techniques to financial data sets; it involves specially designed ML techniques tailored to address the specific challenges faced by financial researchers.
- The primary goal of financial ML should be to aid researchers in the discovery of new economic theories, with these theories driving forecasts rather than the ML algorithms themselves.
- This approach mirrors how scientists use ML across various fields of research, where ML assists in theory discovery rather than directly producing forecasts.

## The Future of Financial Research

- The increasing availability of unstructured and complex data sets presents challenges for traditional quantitative techniques, such as regression models, which may fail to capture complex associations among variables.
- Economics and finance stand to benefit significantly from adopting machine learning (ML) methods, as evidenced by the relatively low integration of ML techniques in research compared to other fields like biology and chemistry.
- The dominance of econometric models in finance and economics education is partly due to historical reasons and the inertia of legacy technologies. However, this dominance does not fully prepare students for industry roles, where ML methods are more prevalent.
- ML and econometrics should be seen as complementary rather than mutually exclusive. ML can assist in identifying key variables and patterns in data, while econometrics can be useful for testing theories grounded in empirical observation.
- There is potential for hybrid approaches that combine ML and econometrics, such as semiparametric methods, to leverage the strengths of both paradigms in analyzing data and testing hypotheses.

## What Are the Risks? Is There Anything That Investors Should Be Aware of or Look Out For?

- Finance and ML require careful consideration: Unlike simpler tasks like driving cars or recognizing faces, modeling financial data is complex due to low signal-to-noise ratio and nonstationary systems.
- ML's computational power can lead to false discoveries: ML algorithms can find patterns even in noisy data, potentially leading to spurious correlations or false predictions.
- ML should not replace economic theory: Investors should understand that ML is not a replacement for economic theory but rather a tool to develop and enhance modern economic theories.
- ML and economic theory should complement each other: There needs to be a balance between ML's capabilities and economic theories to avoid overfitting and ensure accurate predictions.
- Trusting ML blindly is risky: Relying solely on ML without grounding it in economic principles is akin to trusting high-tech horoscopes, emphasizing the importance of theory-ML interplay in investment decisions.

## How Do You Expect ML to Impact the Asset Management Industry in the Next Decade?

- ML's impact on asset management will be significant: Similar to its integration in farming, ML is expected to become a crucial aspect of asset management in the next decade.

## QA

### Can quantitative methods be used to predict events that never happened before? How could quantitative methods predict a black swan?

First, let's define quantitative methods. Quantitative methods involve the use of **mathematical and statistical** techniques to **analyze** data and **make predictions** or decisions. These methods **rely on numerical data and models** to understand and predict phenomena.

Black swan events are **rare and unpredictable** occurrences that have a major impact. They are characterized by their extreme rarity, severe impact, and retrospective predictability.

1. **Data Availability**: Quantitative methods rely on **historical data** to build models and make predictions. If an event has never occurred before, there may be limited or no historical data available to analyze. However, it's essential to note that while specific events may not have occurred before, there may still be data on related phenomena that can be used to inform predictions.

2. **Assumptions and Models**: Quantitative methods often rely on **assumptions** and models to describe the underlying processes governing a system. These models are **based on known principles and patterns** observed in the data. Predicting a black swan event requires challenging these assumptions and considering scenarios that deviate significantly from historical patterns. It may involve developing alternative models or adjusting existing ones to account for extreme possibilities.

3. **Probability and Uncertainty**: Quantitative methods typically provide **probabilistic** forecasts rather than deterministic predictions. They quantify uncertainty and assess the likelihood of different outcomes. Predicting a black swan event involves acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and understanding that such events fall outside the realm of normal probability distributions. It may require incorporating fat-tailed distributions or other methods to account for extreme outliers.

4. **Complex Systems and Emergence**: Many real-world phenomena, including black swan events, emerge from complex systems with nonlinear interactions and feedback loops. While quantitative methods can capture some aspects of these systems, predicting emergent behavior can be challenging. It may require advanced modeling techniques, such as agent-based modeling or complexity theory, to simulate the interactions and dynamics leading to rare events.

# Denoising and Detoning

## Motivation

- Importance of **covariance matrices** in finance: Covariance matrices are extensively used in various financial applications such as regression analysis, risk estimation, portfolio optimization, and simulation.
- Challenges with **empirical covariance matrices**: Empirical covariance matrices computed from observed data contain noise due to finite and non-deterministic nature of observations, rendering them susceptible to inaccuracies.
- Numerical ill-conditioning of covariance matrices from estimated factors: Covariance matrices derived from estimated factors are numerically ill-conditioned because the factors themselves are estimated from imperfect data.
- Need for noise reduction: Unaddressed noise in covariance matrices can significantly impact subsequent calculations and analyses, potentially making them unreliable or ineffective.
- Objective of the section: The section aims to present a procedure for mitigating noise and improving the signal-to-noise ratio in empirical covariance matrices to enhance their usefulness in financial analysis.

## The Marcenko–Pastur Theorem

- It's a math theorem about random matrices.
- Random matrices are like grids of numbers where each number is randomly chosen.
- The theorem talks about what happens when these matrices get really big.
- It helps understand the pattern of eigenvalues, which are special numbers related to matrices.
- Eigenvalues are like the "special numbers" that describe how a matrix stretches or squishes space.
- The theorem helps in understanding how many eigenvalues there are in certain parts of the grid.
- It's important in fields like statistics, physics, and computer science where we deal with lots of data in matrices.
- Overall, it's a tool that helps us understand and work with big, random matrices better.

## Random Matrix with Signal

- We're talking about a special kind of grid of numbers called a covariance matrix.
- Normally, all the relationships between the numbers in this grid are random.
- But sometimes, there's a pattern or signal hidden in some of these numbers.
- This signal might represent something meaningful in the data.
- However, not all the numbers in the grid have this signal; only a few do.
- To make things more complicated, we mix this grid with another random grid.
- This mixing helps to make the signal less obvious, diluting its effect.
- The code mentioned does this mixing and helps us understand how these signals and randomness interact.

## Fitting the Marcenko–Pastur Distribution

- We're trying to understand how much of the variance in a covariance matrix comes from randomness.
- Normally, we assume that all the variance comes from randomness, but sometimes there's a pattern or signal.
- We want to figure out how much of the variance is due to this signal.
- There's a mathematical formula called the Marcenko–Pastur PDF that helps us with this.
- We use this formula to fit a curve to the actual data we have.
- The curve helps us see how much of the variance is explained by randomness and how much by the signal.
- Using a special method, we find a value called σ^2 which tells us about the variance.
- We also find a cutoff level called λ^+ which helps us separate signal from noise.
- This process helps us understand the signal-to-noise ratio in financial data, which is important for making decisions.

## Denoising

- Denoising is like cleaning up a messy picture.
- Sometimes in finance, data can be messy like a jumbled puzzle.
- Shrinkage is like organizing the puzzle pieces to make them fit better.
- But shrinkage doesn't always know what's important and what's not.
- We need a way to tell the difference between important pieces and noise.
- Imagine we have a special tool to find the noisy pieces in the puzzle.
- With this tool, we can clean up the puzzle by removing the noisy parts.
- So, denoising helps us make sense of the data by removing the messy parts without losing important information.

## Constant Residual Eigenvalue Method

```python
import numpy as np


def cov2corr(cov):
    # Derive the correlation matrix from a covariance matrix
    std = np.sqrt(np.diag(cov))
    corr = cov/np.outer(std, std)
    corr[corr < -1], corr[corr > 1] = -1, 1  # numerical error
    return corr


def denoisedCorr(eVal, eVec, nFacts):
    # Remove noise from corr by ﬁxing random eigenvalues
    eVal_ = np.diag(eVal).copy()
    eVal_[nFacts:] = eVal_[nFacts:].sum()/ﬂoat(eVal_.shape[0]-nFacts)
    eVal_ = np.diag(eVal_)
    corr1 = np.dot(eVec, eVal_).dot(eVec.T)
    corr1 = cov2corr(corr1)
    return corr1
```

## Targeted Shrinkage

- Shrinkage is like squeezing or adjusting numbers to make them more reliable.
- The method described earlier removes noise while keeping the important stuff.
- But sometimes, we only want to shrink the parts that are noisy, not the important parts.
- It's like fixing only the blurry parts of a photo without changing the clear parts.
- This targeted shrinkage focuses on adjusting the random parts, leaving the rest untouched.
- By doing this, we keep the signal (important stuff) intact while reducing noise.
- It's a way to improve data quality without losing important information.
- This method is useful in fields like finance where accurate data analysis is crucial.

## Detoning

- Financial correlation matrices often have a part related to the overall market.
- This market part affects every item in the matrix, showing how everything moves together.
- Sometimes, we want to remove this market part to better understand other relationships.
- Removing the market part makes it easier to group similar things together (like stocks).
- It's like taking out a loud noise from music to hear the other instruments better.
- This process is called detoning, and it's like adjusting the volume of different parts of the data.
- After detoning, the correlation matrix might not look the same, but it helps in grouping things more effectively.
- We can't directly use the detoned matrix for some calculations, but we can still use it to make smart investment decisions.

## Minimum Variance and Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio

- Denoising and detoning covariance matrices brings big benefits in data analysis.
- These benefits are tested using Monte Carlo experiments, a method where you repeat tests many times with random inputs.
- The experiments focus on two important portfolios: the minimum variance and maximum Sharpe ratio portfolios.
- For the minimum variance portfolio, denoising reduces errors by a lot compared to not denoising.
- Denoising is much better than shrinkage at reducing errors for the minimum variance portfolio.
- Shrinkage doesn't add much benefit when combined with denoising for the minimum variance portfolio.
- Similar results are seen for the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio: denoising reduces errors by a lot compared to not denoising.
- Again, shrinkage isn't very helpful when combined with denoising for the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio.

### What is minimum variance stock portfolio?

- A minimum variance stock portfolio is like a mix of stocks carefully chosen to minimize risk.
- Imagine you have different stocks in your investment portfolio.
- Each stock has its own ups and downs, making your portfolio risky.
- A minimum variance portfolio aims to minimize this risk.
- It selects a combination of stocks that reduces the portfolio's overall volatility.
- This means even if one stock performs poorly, others can help balance it out.
- The goal is to achieve the lowest possible variance, or fluctuation, in portfolio returns.
- By carefully selecting stocks with low correlation and volatility, investors can create a more stable investment strategy.
