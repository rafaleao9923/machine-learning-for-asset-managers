**SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** is a game theoretic approach to
explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit
allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game
theory and their related extensions (see
[papers](https://github.com/slundberg/shap#citations) for details and
citations).

It is powerful feature importance tool that is gathering a lot of attention in
both the machine learning and quantitative finance community.

There is a really good, open source (MIT License) implementation of the
technique, available on Github.
